Code to drive the Vacuum Fluorescent Display
============================================

Functions to enable the Raspberry Pi to drive the [20T202DA2JA 20x2 Character VFD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/347). This display came from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/347) but is now discontinued. There are Arduino libraries [available](https://github.com/adafruit/SPI_VFD) for it, but nothing for the Pi. I had a go at hacking something together, but [ThisOldGeek](https://thisoldgeek.blogspot.com/) had already written something about it at https://thisoldgeek.blogspot.com/2013/02/spi-for-samsung-vfd-on-raspberry-pi.html. The initial code for DisplayTest.py came from [github.com/thisoldgeek/RPi_SPI_VFD/Hello_World.py](https://github.com/thisoldgeek/RPi_SPI_VFD/blob/master/Hello_World.py)
